This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform topic modeling on a collection of customer reviews using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The primary objective is to uncover dominant themes and insights in customer sentiment, which can inform strategic decisions in product development and customer experience.

Key Features
Text Preprocessing: Tokenisation, stopword removal, and lemmatisation to clean and prepare text.

Topic Modeling: Implementation of LDA to identify and visualise key themes in the text corpus.

Interactive Visualisation: PyLDAvis used to explore topic relevance and keyword distributions interactively.

Insights
Revealed underlying topics customers commonly discuss, such as product quality, service experience, and pricing.

Provided visual representations to interpret topic importance and keyword associations.

Enabled interpretation of customer sentiment patterns to support business decision-making.
